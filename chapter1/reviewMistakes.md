## Regularly engaging in reflection on one’s own mistakes.
Humans have a persistent tendency to repeat mistakes in similar contexts. The most effective way to prevent such errors is to continually reinforce the memory of prior failures. By doing so, individuals can, when confronted with analogous situations, spontaneously recall where they previously went wrong. This heightened awareness encourages greater caution in handling similar circumstances, thereby reducing the likelihood of repeating the same mistakes.

## 时常反思自己的错。
人类是不断地会在同一个地方犯错。避免犯错的最佳方法就是不断地重复自己犯错的记忆。让自己在面临相同的情况下时，能够自然而然地反应过来自己曾在此处出错。然后自己便会十分小心地处理这类情况，从而达到避免出错的目的。
